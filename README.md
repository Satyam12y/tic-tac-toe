 His project is a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users. Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. This project brings the game to the web in a visually appealing and responsive format, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
